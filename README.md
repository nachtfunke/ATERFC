# ATERFC - Advancing Technological Empowerment for Radical Faerie Communities

This is a repository collecting all efforts, dedicated to the ATERFC Cause, which is to support Radical Faerie Communities in using technology to empower themselves.

## Background

Radical Faerie Communities are often diverse in all aspects, especially in their members capability to use technology for empowerment. Not rarely, there is even a narrative of seeing technology as counterproductive to faerie space. This results in some tangible symptoms:

+ inaccessible Websites
+ convoluted registration processes for gatherings
+ intransparent, innaccessible organisational processes
+ stagnating progress in organising activities
+ volatility in contribution from individuals and organisations
+ misunderstanding about indications and dedications of their shared systems
+ inaccessible organisational structures
+ generational gaps

Many faeries believe that technology can help to either releive these problems or decrease their severity or solve the underlying problems that lead to these symptoms.

## How the ATERFC wants to help

Faeries dedicated to this cause want to help radical faerie communities to empower themselves with technologies. This advancement can happen in several ways:

+ Informing about solutions
+ Demystifying certain concepts and misunderstandings about technology
+ Providing useful educational content
+ Helping in setting up services (like buying a domain, or discord / slack channel)
+ Holding Workshops at gatherings
+ Prodiving Webspace, Subdomains or Mailspace for communities
